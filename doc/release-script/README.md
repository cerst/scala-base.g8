# Release Script

This directory contains a rather basic release script which does the following:

1. Run a set of pre-release tasks
2. Determine and confirm the current version (to be released)
3. Ensure that the current Git branch is master
4. Run a set of release tasks

As a start, you may want to modify the tasks of steps 1 & 4.
